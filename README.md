I'm a developer focused on delivering high-quality Front-end solutions. My engineering background includes, but is not limited to Angular, React and Node.js microservices. I enjoy exploring the capabilities of modern tools, which leads engineering towards new, flexible solutions.

- 🎓  I'm in the last semester of my Technologist Degree in System Analysis and Development.

- 👨🏻‍💻  In my current experience, I am responsible for ensuring the security of web application data from one of the largest financial institutions in Brazil.

- 📚  I'm a huge enthusiast of Typescript and the React library, but lately, I've been focusing my studies on mastering Angular development.
